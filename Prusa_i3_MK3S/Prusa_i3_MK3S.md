# General
The [Prusa i3 Mk3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-3/) is a fused filament fabrication (FFF) type 3D printer.  That means that it carefully melts plastic into whatever shape you want under computer control - kind of like a hot melt glue gun that follows directions.

## Getting started (ask a mentor if you have any questions)
1. Make sure PLA plastic is loaded.
2. Clean the print bed with Isopropyl Alcohol.
3. Select "Print from SD card" in the printer menu.
4. Find the file for "Snap on spacers".

> At this point, the printer will take a lot of time to heat up, measure how level the printbed is, and then start to print.
> Be patient!

5. After your print is done, wait for the printbed to cool down before removing it.

## Level Up Your Skills!
1. Print in PETG. (This requires a different sheet on the heated bed!)
2. Design your own flat object in CAD. (much faster to print)
3. Design your own 3D object in CAD. (keep it less than 2 inches square, or it will take forever to print)
