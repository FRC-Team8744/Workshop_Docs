# First Robotics Team 8744 Workshop Guides
The intent of this documentation is to help the students become more self-directed.  If they are interested in learning about a tool, they walk up to it and scan the QR code on the machine with their phone (it is highly unusual for high school students to be without a smartphone).  They are presented with information about the tool, guidelines on how to use it, and a 'skill builder' tutorial project to teach them the basics.

## Implementation Details
The documentation is archived on Github, but the user interacts with a rendering on readthedocs.io.  All documents are written in simple markdown, so it is easy to update and keep under revision control.
